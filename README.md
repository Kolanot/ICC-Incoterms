International Commercial Terms (‘Incoterms’) are internationally recognised standard trade terms used in sales contracts. They’re used to make sure buyer and seller know:

* who is responsible for the cost of transporting the goods, including insurance, taxes and duties
* where the goods should be picked up from and transported to
* who is responsible for the goods at each step during transportation
